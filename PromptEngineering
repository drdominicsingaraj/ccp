# Prompt Engineering Guide

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs that elicit the desired outputs from AI models, particularly language models like GPT-4. Below are some strategies and tactics for effective prompt engineering.

## Strategies for Better Results

### Write Clear Instructions

- Be specific about what you want the model to do.
- Provide examples if possible.
- Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt.

### Provide Reference Text

- Supplying reference material can guide the model to give more accurate responses.
- Ask the model to use the reference text in its answers.

### Break Down Complex Tasks

- Simplify tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Use the output of one task as the input for the next.

### Allow Time for "Thinking"

- Encourage the model to reason through a problem before providing an answer.

## Tactics for Prompt Engineering

- **Include Details**: The more context you provide, the better the model's response.
- **Adopt a Persona**: Ask the model to assume a specific role for more tailored responses.
- **Specify Output Length**: If you need a concise or detailed answer, let the model know.

Remember, prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. Experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts.
