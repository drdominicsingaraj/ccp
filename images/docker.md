# Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, run, manage, and distribute applications by using containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Amazon ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry provided by AWS. It allows developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. It's integrated with Amazon ECS and EKS, simplifying your development to production workflow.

## Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS. It allows you to run, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker containers. ECS can be used with AWS Fargate, which is a serverless compute engine that removes the need to provision and manage servers.

## Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Amazon EKS is a managed service that makes it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications and integrates with AWS services for secure networking, monitoring, and scaling.
