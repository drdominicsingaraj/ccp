## Setting up budget Alerts

Setting up budget alerts in AWS is a straightforward process that can help you manage your costs effectively. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you configure budget alerts:

6. **Set Up a Role**: To use budget actions, create a service role for AWS Budgets that grants the necessary permissions for AWS Budgets to perform actions on your behalf.

7. **Review and Approve**: Review your budget and alert configurations, and approve them to activate the alerts.

8. **Monitor Alerts**: Once set up, you will receive notifications via email or Amazon SNS topics when your budget thresholds are exceeded or forecasted to be exceeded.
