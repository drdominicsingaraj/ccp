1. QUESTION

Which service offers volume discounts when you enable Consolidated Billing? 

    Amazon SNS
    Amazon S3 (Answer)
    AWS CloudTrail
    Amazon CloudFront

Explanation: 
For billing purposes, AWS treats all of the accounts in the organization as if they were one account. Some services, such as AWS Data Transfer and Amazon S3, have volume pricing tiers across certain usage dimensions that give you lower prices the more you use the service. With consolidated billing, AWS combines the usage from all accounts to determine which volume pricing tiers to apply, giving you a lower overall price whenever possible. AWS then allocates each member account a portion of the overall volume discount based on the account's usage.
For example, let's say that Bob's consolidated bill includes both Bob's own account and Susan's account. Bob's account is the management account, so he pays the charges for both himself and Susan.
Bob transfers 8 TB of data during the month and Susan transfers 4 TB.

For the purposes of this example, AWS charges $0.17 per GB for the first 10 TB of data transferred and $0.13 for the next 40 TB. This translates into $174.08 per TB (= .17*1024) for the first 10 TB, and $133.12 per TB (= .13*1024) for the next 40 TB. Remember that 1 TB = 1024 GB.
