# Generative-AI & AWS

AWS offers a range of generative AI solutions designed to help businesses innovate faster and boost productivity. Here are some of the key offerings:

- **Amazon Bedrock**: A platform that allows you to build and scale generative AI applications with access to foundation models like Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku.

- **Generative AI Application Builder**: This solution helps in the rapid development and deployment of generative AI applications, facilitating experimentation and integration with Amazon Bedrock and other large language models (LLMs) deployed on Amazon SageMaker.

- **AWS Inferentia2 Chips**: These are used in Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances to lower the cost of running generative AI workloads.

- **AWS Trainium Chips**: Custom silicon designed to train models faster, available in new Trn1n instances.

- **Amazon CodeWhisperer**: A service that provides real-time coding assistance, now available for free to individual developers.

These solutions are built with security, privacy, and responsible AI practices from the start, and they leverage AWS's performant and cost-effective infrastructure. For more detailed information, you can explore the AWS Generative AI page.
