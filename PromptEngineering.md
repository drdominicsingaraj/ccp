# Prompt Engineering Guide

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs that elicit the desired outputs from AI models, particularly language models like GPT-4. Below are some strategies and tactics for effective prompt engineering.

## Understanding 'Prompt' in Prompt Engineering

In the realm of **prompt engineering**, a 'prompt' is a carefully crafted input that guides an AI model, especially language models like GPT-4, to produce a specific desired output. 

### Definition of a Prompt

A **prompt** in this context is:

- A **set of instructions** or a **question** designed to elicit a particular response from the model.
- Often includes **context**, **examples**, or **constraints** to shape the model's response.

### Components of a Prompt

- **Instruction**: What you want the model to do (e.g., summarize, translate, answer).
- **Context**: Background information that informs the response.
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and outputs that illustrate the task.
- **Constraints**: Limitations on the response, such as length or format.

### Example

```markdown
Prompt: Given the following ingredients, generate a recipe that includes steps and measurements.
Ingredients: Chicken, tomatoes, basil, pasta.
```

## Strategies for Better Results

| Aspect                | Details                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write Clear Instructions | - Be specific about what you want the model to do.       |
|                         | - Provide examples if possible.                          |
|                         | - Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt. |
| Provide Reference Text | - Supplying reference material can guide the model to give more accurate responses. |
|                         | - Ask the model to use the reference text in its answers. |
| Break Down Complex Tasks | - Simplify tasks into smaller, manageable steps.         |
|                         | - Use the output of one task as the input for the next.   |
| Allow Time for "Thinking" | - Encourage the model to reason through a problem before providing an answer. |

### Tactics for Prompt Engineering

- **Include Details**: The more context you provide, the better the model's response.
- **Adopt a Persona**: Ask the model to assume a specific role for more tailored responses.
- **Specify Output Length**: If you need a concise or detailed answer, let the model know.

Remember, prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. Experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts.

## Iterative Approach

- **Zero-shot**: Start without examples and see how the model performs.
- **Few-shot**: Provide a couple of examples if zero-shot doesn't work.
- **Fine-tune**: If necessary, fine-tune the model with more examples.

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting is when you provide a prompt to the model without any prior examples for the specific task you're asking it to perform. The model uses its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response. It's like asking someone to perform a task they haven't done before, but they use their general knowledge to attempt it.

**Example**:
**Prompt**: "Explain the theory of relativity."
**Model's Response**: The model draws on its pre-existing knowledge to explain the theory without any prior examples.

### Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting involves giving the model a few examples of the task at hand before asking it to perform a similar task. This helps the model understand the context and the type of response expected. It's akin to giving someone a quick lesson or a few examples before they try something new.

**Example**:
**Prompt**: "Here are two summaries of scientific papers. Now, summarize this third paper in a similar style."
**Model's Response**: The model uses the structure and style of the provided summaries to create a new summary for the third paper.

### Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is a more involved process where the model is trained further on a specific set of data. This process adjusts the model's parameters to perform better on tasks similar to the new examples it has been given. It's like practicing with more examples to get better at a particular task.

**Example**:
**Scenario**: A company wants to use a language model to answer customer service inquiries in the tone of their brand.
**Process**: They provide the model with hundreds of examples of past customer service interactions.
**Outcome**: The model's responses are fine-tuned to reflect the company's specific brand tone and style.

These methods are used in prompt engineering to guide the model towards generating the desired output. Zero-shot can be useful when the task is general and falls within the model's pre-trained capabilities. Few-shot is helpful when you need the model to understand a specific format or context. Fine-tuning is used for specialized tasks where the model needs to adapt to new information or a particular style.
