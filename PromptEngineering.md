# Prompt Engineering Guide

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs that elicit the desired outputs from AI models, particularly language models like GPT-4. Below are some strategies and tactics for effective prompt engineering.

## Understanding 'Prompt' in Prompt Engineering

In the realm of **prompt engineering**, a 'prompt' is a carefully crafted input that guides an AI model, especially language models like GPT-4, to produce a specific desired output. 

### Definition of a Prompt

A **prompt** in this context is:

- A **set of instructions** or a **question** designed to elicit a particular response from the model.
- Often includes **context**, **examples**, or **constraints** to shape the model's response.

### Components of a Prompt

- **Instruction**: What you want the model to do (e.g., summarize, translate, answer).
- **Context**: Background information that informs the response.
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and outputs that illustrate the task.
- **Constraints**: Limitations on the response, such as length or format.

### Example

```markdown
Prompt: Given the following ingredients, generate a recipe that includes steps and measurements.
Ingredients: Chicken, tomatoes, basil, pasta.
```

## Strategies for Better Results

| Aspect                | Details                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write Clear Instructions | - Be specific about what you want the model to do.       |
|                         | - Provide examples if possible.                          |
|                         | - Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt. |
| Provide Reference Text | - Supplying reference material can guide the model to give more accurate responses. |
|                         | - Ask the model to use the reference text in its answers. |
| Break Down Complex Tasks | - Simplify tasks into smaller, manageable steps.         |
|                         | - Use the output of one task as the input for the next.   |
| Allow Time for "Thinking" | - Encourage the model to reason through a problem before providing an answer. |

### Tactics for Prompt Engineering

- **Include Details**: The more context you provide, the better the model's response.
- **Adopt a Persona**: Ask the model to assume a specific role for more tailored responses.
- **Specify Output Length**: If you need a concise or detailed answer, let the model know.

Remember, prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. Experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts.

## Iterative Approach

- **Zero-shot**: Start without examples and see how the model performs.
- **Few-shot**: Provide a couple of examples if zero-shot doesn't work.
- **Fine-tune**: If necessary, fine-tune the model with more examples.
