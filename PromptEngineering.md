# Prompt Engineering Guide

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs that elicit the desired outputs from AI models, particularly language models like GPT-4. Below are some strategies and tactics for effective prompt engineering.

## Strategies for Better Results

### Write Clear Instructions

- Be specific about what you want the model to do.
- Provide examples if possible.
- Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt.

### Provide Reference Text

- Supplying reference material can guide the model to give more accurate responses.
- Ask the model to use the reference text in its answers.

### Break Down Complex Tasks

- Simplify tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Use the output of one task as the input for the next.

### Allow Time for "Thinking"

- Encourage the model to reason through a problem before providing an answer.

## Tactics for Prompt Engineering

- **Include Details**: The more context you provide, the better the model's response.
- **Adopt a Persona**: Ask the model to assume a specific role for more tailored responses.
- **Specify Output Length**: If you need a concise or detailed answer, let the model know.

Remember, prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. Experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts.

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

Effective prompt engineering is crucial for eliciting the desired responses from AI models. Here are some best practices to follow:

## Clarity and Specificity

- **Be Clear**: Write instructions that are easy to understand.
- **Be Specific**: Provide detailed descriptions of what you want the model to do.

## Structuring Prompts

- **Use Delimiters**: Separate instructions and context with `###` or triple quotes `"""`.
- **Provide Examples**: Show the model exactly what you're looking for.

## Context and Detail

- **Add Context**: Give the model enough information to understand the task.
- **Include Details**: Specify the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc.

## Output Formatting

- **Articulate Desired Format**: Use examples to show the model how you want the information presented.

## Iterative Approach

- **Zero-shot**: Start without examples and see how the model performs.
- **Few-shot**: Provide a couple of examples if zero-shot doesn't work.
- **Fine-tune**: If necessary, fine-tune the model with more examples.
